#Blackjack LTD

For this project, I decided to build a standalone embedded system that could allow the user to play a game of blackjack. 

There are two versions of the code, a .py file and a .ino file. Only the .ino file should be uploaded to an Arduino for use. 

The schematics explain how to setup the LCD display and how to wire a button for user input.
